# MeerKAT Science Data Processor Calibration Procedures (katsdpcalproc)

This package contains calibration procedures (such as solvers, fitters,
averagers and other low-level routines) for the MeerKAT calibration pipeline.
This makes it easy to import these into other projects, without depending on
the full machinery of the pipeline.
